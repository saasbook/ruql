Usage: #<Enumerator:0x979a960> filename.rb renderer [options]
filename.rb contains questions expressed in RuQL

renderer choices are:
  Html5   - HTML 5 suitable for Web display/printing
  EdXml   - XML for OpenEdX platform in-course questions
  AutoQCM - LaTeX for use with AutoQCM (http://home.gna.org/auto-qcm)
  Coursera- [obsolete] Coursera HTML/XML format for online auto-grading
  JSON    - [partially implemented] JSON format

Global options:
  -l <loglevel>, --log=<loglevel>
     In increasing verbosity, they are 'error' (nonfatal), 'warn', 'info',
     'debug'; default is 'warn'
  -p <penalty>, --penalty <penalty>
     The penalty for WRONG answers, as a fraction of the penalty for
     RIGHT answers.  For a 2-point question, penalty=0.25 means 1/2 point
     (0.25 * 2) deducted for WRONG answer.  Default is 0.  Not all
     output formats are able to do something useful with this.

The EdXML renderer supports these options:
  -n <name>, --name=<name>
      Only render the question(s) that have :name => 'name'.
  NOTE: Some markup that is legal in RuQL questions will break the EdX parser.
     Manually check your questions as you enter them into EdX.  Code seems to
     be particularly troublesome.
  NOTE: The 'points' and 'randomize' attributes of questions are not honored by
     some systems.

The HTML5 renderer supports these options:
  -c <href>, --css=<href>
      embed <href> for stylesheet into generated HTML5
  -t <file.html.erb>, --template=<file.html.erb>
      Use file.html.erb as HTML template rather than generating our own file.
      file.html.erb should have <%= yield %> where questions should go.
      An example is in the templates/ directory of RuQL.
      The following local variables will be replaced with their values in
      the template: 
        <%= quiz.title %> - the quiz title
        <%= quiz.num_questions %> - total number of questions
        <%= quiz.points %> - total number of points for whole quiz
  -s, --solutions
      generate solutions (showing correct answers and explanations)
  NOTE: If there is more than one quiz (collection of questions) in the file,
      a complete <html>...</html> block is produced in the output for EACH quiz.

The AutoQCM renderer supports these options:
  -t <file.tex.erb>, --template=<file.tex.erb>
      MANDATORY: Use file.tex.erb as LaTeX/AutoQCM template.
      The file should have <%= yield %> where questions should go.
      See the description of template under HTML5 renderer for variable
      substitutions that can occur in the quiz body.

The JSON renderer currently supports no options
